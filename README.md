# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 challenge


## Background of the challenge:

I was asked to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, from an external site, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


## Features of the code:

Fetches data from an external JSON file.
Initializes a web page with default data visualizations.
Provides a dropdown menu to select different datasets.
Dynamically updates demographic information, a horizontal bar chart, and a bubble chart based on the selected dataset.
Utilizes D3 for data manipulation and Plotly for chart creation.


## Usage of the code:

When the web page loads, it will fetch data from the specified URL and initialize with default visualizations for the first dataset in the data file.
Use the dropdown menu to select different datasets. The demographic information, horizontal bar chart, and bubble chart will update accordingly based on the selected dataset.
Customize the charts and display by modifying the code within the barchart, bubblechart, and demographic functions to suit your data and design preferences.


## Deployment:
